## Method
The data focused on the First Quarter of the 2018-2020 period, and the aim was to find any trends or changes in ridership due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The data was pulled from the Citi Bike page for the periods in question. As of writing this document no data for April 2020 was available. It would have been extremely interesting to see the metrics while the shutdown of NYC was in full force.

## Observations
### Covid-19
As expected there was a decline in ridership in the Month of March 2020. Usually there is an increase in activity as the weather gets warmer, however this year experienced a decline instead. An unexpected observation was the fact that average trip length saw a significant increase from the month of February 2020. Compared with the previous two years the increase is rather modest.

### Gender and Generation
It would be interesting to see if there were any differences in gender and age generation with respect to trip duration. As expected most of the users of the service were Millenials and Gen X. One finding which I found curious was the fact that females tend to use the service for a longer period of time on average. One limitation was the fact that the data contained an `unknonwn` gender option. These values were filtered out of the analysis as their inclusion would muddle up the results.

### Start and End Trip Frequency Map
By looking at the distribution of start trips in the map, most users began their trips outside of a line South of Central Park with a heavy concentration in the boroughs outside of Manhattan. When it came to end trips the distribution was mostly even with a few hotspots near popular attractions.
